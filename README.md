# Frontend Mentor - Social proof section

![Design preview for the Social proof section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)


## The challenge
This is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions) <br>
The challenge was to build out this social proof section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Solution
The page is done using Sass with BEM naming.
